# From *Awareness* to *Consciousness* 

## Why We Must Begin

In every era, humans have asked the same impossible question:
> *Why do we exist?*

Religion answered with faith.
Science answered with function.
Philosophy answered with reflection.

**But none gave us a structure.**

The need for a **philosophy** that aproaches existence from a different lens has been pressured into being by technological advancement and the rise of **AI**. 

*It seems humanity has lost its meaning in the age of light and speed.*
**Nilogism** was born from the need to anchor the **human mind** in an **objective reality**.

We seek precision, not in equations, but in causes and that precision is gifted to us by **Logic**! 

## What is Logic?

**Acoording to Google:**

Logic is the study of reasoning, specifically how to distinguish between good and bad reasoning. 

It provides a framework for analyzing arguments, identifying valid inferences, and determining whether conclusions follow logically from given premises. 

In essence, logic helps us understand how to think critically and make sound judgments. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:

> **Reasoning and Inference:**
> Logic is concerned with the process of drawing conclusions based on evidence or premises. 

> **Formal vs. Informal Logic:**
> Formal logic focuses on the structure of arguments, while informal logic examines the content and context of arguments. 

> **Key Concepts:**
> Logic involves understanding concepts like validity, soundness, truth, and logical fallacies. 

> **Applications:**
> Logic is used in various fields, including mathematics, computer science, philosophy, and everyday decision-making. 

> **Importance:**
> Developing logical thinking skills is crucial for evaluating information, forming sound arguments, and making informed decisions. 

## Using logic we will do our best to highlight the causes of Awareness, Identity, Memory, Language, Purpose and Consciousness.
