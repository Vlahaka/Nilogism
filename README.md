# Nilogism-
"Nothing" is absolute absence. no time, no motion, no entropy, no awareness. Not even the ability of self-observation. Nilogism is a philosophy of logic that begins from true non-existence. If all existence is built layer by layer from the impossibility of non-being, then truth must be objective, structural, and universal.
